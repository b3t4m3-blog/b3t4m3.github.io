  <p>SwagShop from HackTheBox is an retired machine which had a web service running with an outdated vulnerable Magento CMS that allows us to perform an RCE using Froghopper Attack and get a reverse shell. Later we can exploit sudo privileges to run vi as root through sudo command and exploit it to get root shell.</p>

<h2 id="enumeration">Enumeration</h2>
<p>Lets start out with Nmap scan to find out open ports and services:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Posts/Swagshop/nmap.png" alt="Nmap Scan" /></p>

<p>We got open port <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">22 &amp; 80</code> and <strong>HTTP</strong> service running on port 80.</p>

<h2 id="web-service-enumeration">Web Service Enumeration</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Posts/Swagshop/magento.png" alt="Magento HomeScreen" /></p>

<p>The web application is running on <strong>Magento CMS</strong> and on the bottom of the page we observe that it’s running on 2014 version so lets try searching for exploits and in background run wfuzz to find out directories associated with this application</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Posts/Swagshop/wfuzz.png" alt="wfuzz" /></p>

<p>Lets run Searchsploit to look for publicly available exploits and we found out a exploit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Magento eCommerce- Remote code Execution-37977.py</code> that creates a admin account on Magento CMS which can be used to login to admin panel on <a href="http://swagshop.htb/index.php/admin/">http://swagshop.htb/index.php/admin/</a></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Posts/Swagshop/searchsploit.png" alt="searchsploit" /></p>

<h2 id="creating-an-admin-user">Creating an Admin User</h2>

<p>The Magento eCommerce- Remote code Execution exploit creates a new admin account with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">forme/forme</code> as credentials. I just modified the target and the credentials as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cfx/cfx</code> and launched it to get an admin account</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Posts/Swagshop/exploit.png" alt="exploit" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Posts/Swagshop/exploit1.png" alt="exploit1" /></p>

<p>Now we can login to the admin panel on <a href="http://swagshop.htb/index.php/admin/">http://swagshop.htb/index.php/admin/</a> using the credentials <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cfx:cfx</code></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Posts/Swagshop/login.png" alt="login" /></p>

<h2 id="froghopper-attack---magento-rce">Froghopper Attack - Magento RCE</h2>

<p>Initially when I did this box I used Magento connect manager to add an file system extension through you could add or edit PHP files to get an reverse shell but now that vector has been removed and the only method which we can use is called <strong>Froghopper attack</strong></p>

<p>Using this <a href="https://www.foregenix.com/blog/anatomy-of-a-magento-attack-froghopper"><strong>article</strong></a> I was able to use this attack, We start by allowing the symlinks option in template settings:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Posts/Swagshop/frog1.png" alt="frog1" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Posts/Swagshop/frog2.png" alt="frog2" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Posts/Swagshop/frog3.png" alt="frog3" /></p>

<p>Now since we have to upload a png file as a category thumbnail so we take a png file and echo a reverse shell in it:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Posts/Swagshop/revshell.png" alt="revshell" /></p>

<p>Uploading the png file to Catalog &gt; Manage categories:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Posts/Swagshop/upload.png" alt="upload" /></p>

<p>As we can check if our image file has been uploaded successfully by visiting <a href="http://swagshop.htb/media/catalog/category/shell.php.png">http://swagshop.htb/media/catalog/category/shell.php.png</a></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Posts/Swagshop/upload1.png" alt="upload1" /></p>

<p>Now we have to create a newsletter template and inject the payload mentioned in the article: ``</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Posts/Swagshop/template.png" alt="template" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Posts/Swagshop/template1.png" alt="template1" /></p>

<p>We just have to save the template and later preview template to spawn our reverse shell.</p>

<h2 id="shell-as-www-data">Shell as www-data</h2>

<p>Lets start the listener on port 4444 and then click on preview template button.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Posts/Swagshop/shell.png" alt="shell" /></p>

<p>We see the user flag in the home directory of user haris.</p>

<h2 id="privilege-escalation">Privilege Escalation</h2>

<p>The user www-data has sudo privileges to execute binary <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vi</code> as root. We can spawn a shell from within vi using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:!/bin/sh</code> and it’ll spawn root shell.</p>
