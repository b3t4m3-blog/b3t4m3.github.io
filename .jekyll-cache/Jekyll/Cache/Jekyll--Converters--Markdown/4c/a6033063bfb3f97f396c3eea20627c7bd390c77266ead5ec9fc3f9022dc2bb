  <p>Travel from HackTheBox is an amazing machine as it involves Source Code review and SSRF which I personally enjoy a lot. We’ll start with basic enumeration where we land up with multiple VHosts, while fuzzing them we discover an exposed .git folder. This git folder provides us PHP source code of an custom RSS feed functionality being used on the blog, which accepts user supplied inputs and cache it using memcache. On further analysing we find an PHP deserialization vulnerability inside memcache, as memcache deserializes data upon retrieving it from cache. We’ll perform an SSRF using gopher protocol and exploit it by poisoning the memcache with a serialized PHP payload containing an command shell which will give us RCE and eventually a reverse shell inside a docker container. Subsequently we’ll find password hash of a user who is an LDAP administrator, crack it using john, SSH to server and grab the user flag. For elevating privileges to root, we will manipulate attributes of a user in an LDAP database by adding it to sudo group, adding SSH public key &amp; password attributes to their LDAP using a GUI tool. Additionally, we will also gain root by adding the user to docker group using it as the second privilege escalation vector.</p>
