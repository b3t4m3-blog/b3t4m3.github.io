  <p>Dyplesher was one of the toughest machine Iâ€™ve ever encountered with lots of new things to learn. Initial enumeration leads us to a virtual host with a .git directory exposing credentials for memcached. After understanding memcached is using binary protocol for authentication, rather than guessing key names to dump data I wrote my own memcache key brute forcing script, using this script we are able to dump username and password from the cache. One of these credentials allows us to access Gogs, Inside Gogs we discover a GitLab backup containing four git bundles, one of these bundles contains Minecraft plugin data along with a SQLite database file containing a password hash, Cracked password authorizes login to Dyplesher Dashboard. Using this dashboard we can upload and run Minecraft plugins, Weâ€™ll then write a malicious plugin that Injects a SSH key and also writes a PHP backdoor webshell on the server, Leveraging SSH key weâ€™ll access the box where we discover the user is part of Wireshark group having access to dumpcap binary, utilizing it weâ€™ll capture raw traffic over loopback interface discovering AMQP packets containing username and passwords of multiple users. One of these users has a note to send plugin download URL over RabbitMQ queue which gets the server to download and execute a Cuberite Plugin. Weâ€™ll create a malicious Lua Script (Cuberite Plugin) which on execution drops a SSH key to root allowing us to elevate privileges to root.</p>
