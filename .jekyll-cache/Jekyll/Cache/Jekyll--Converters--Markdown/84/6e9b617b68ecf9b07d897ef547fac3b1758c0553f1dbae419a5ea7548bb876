  <p>Blackfield was a exceptional Windows box centralized on Active Directory environment, initial SMB enumeration reveals potential usernames of Domain accounts. We validate them using kerbrute - a tool which send TGT requests with no pre-authentication property to validate user accounts. Later we use AS-REP roasting technique to find and crack the hash of an account. With the new user creds weâ€™ll use BloodHound to discover an special privilege where we can forcefully change password for another account over RPC. Further with the newly owned account we get access to an SMB share containing data retrieved during audit and forensic investigation, where we find a memory capture of LSASS process and dump the hashes from it using pypykatz. Using the discovered hash we get an WinRM Shell on the box. For elevating privileges to Administrator weâ€™ll abuse Backup privileges of a Backup Operator to grab a copy of NTDS.dit and SYSTEM hive and retrieve Administrator hash.</p>
