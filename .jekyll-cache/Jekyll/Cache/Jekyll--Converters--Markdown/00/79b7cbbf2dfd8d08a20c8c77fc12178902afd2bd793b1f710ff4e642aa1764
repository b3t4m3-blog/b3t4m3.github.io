  <p>Blunder was an cool box with two interdependent web application vulnerabilities, Starting off with Web Enumeration we discover a blog hosted on Bludit CMS, going through Github releases indicates the version is vulnerable to bypass a anti brute force mechanism, along with it a authenticated user can also achieve Remote Code execution via bypassing Image Upload functionality. To commence brute force attack Iâ€™ll write my own exploit code and get the credentials. However, Rather than using Metasploit to obtain remote code execution, Iâ€™ll do it manually to bypass Image upload filter and get a shell on the box. Furthermore, inside a database config file we creds for another user and pivot to it. For elevating privileges to root, weâ€™ll exploit CVE-2019-14287 aka sudo vulnerability which allows a user to evade security policy and execute command as root even though the user is restricted to do so.</p>
