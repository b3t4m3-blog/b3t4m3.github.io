  <p>Fuse is based on Printers in corporate environment making it quite realistic machine, Weâ€™ll complete it using both Intended and Unintended method. We start off with web enumeration of a printer page, collecting potential usernames from several print job logs the use cewl to create a password wordlist. Using this data we initiate a Password Spray attack where we discover users with expired password then change the password of a account, use it to access rpcclient where we discover a password inside printer description. Using this password we get WinRM access of a printer service account with SeLoadDriverPrivilege enabled which allows the user to load kernel drivers. For abusing this privilege weâ€™ll make use of infamous Capcom driver to load a payload which creates a local administrator account and access it via WinRM. In Unintended method weâ€™ll exploit ZeroLogon (CVE-2020-1472) to dump Admin NT hash.</p>
